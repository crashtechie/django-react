The project had 6 moderate severity npm vulnerabilities related to the esbuild package used by Vite and Vitest.

## Root Cause
- The esbuild vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99) affected versions â‰¤0.24.2
- This vulnerability allows any website to send requests to the development server and read responses
- The issue was present in:
  - Vite 5.4.20 (used vulnerable esbuild)
  - Vitest 1.6.1 (used vulnerable vite/esbuild via vite-node)

## Solution Applied
Successfully upgraded all affected packages to their latest secure versions:

### Major Package Updates
- **Vite**: 5.4.20 â†’ 7.1.7
- **Vitest**: 1.6.1 â†’ 3.2.4
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: 4.7.0 â†’ 5.0.1
- **@vitest/coverage-v8**: 1.6.1 â†’ 3.2.4
- **@vitest/ui**: 1.6.1 â†’ 3.2.4

### Configuration Updates Required
Due to the major version upgrades, the following configurations needed updates:

1. **PostCSS Configuration** (`postcss.config.js`)
   - Changed from CommonJS to ES modules syntax
   - Updated: `module.exports = {}` â†’ `export default {}`

2. **TypeScript Configuration** (`tsconfig.json`)
   - Removed `vite.config.ts` from include array to prevent build conflicts
   - Build process now uses separate `tsconfig.node.json` for tool configs

3. **Testing Setup**
   - Added @testing-library packages for component testing
   - Updated test to include BrowserRouter context for routing components

## Verification
- âœ… `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities
- âœ… All tests pass with new Vitest 3.2.4
- âœ… Application builds successfully with Vite 7.1.7
- âœ… All functionality preserved during upgrades

## Security Status
ðŸ”’ **RESOLVED** - All npm vulnerabilities have been eliminated while maintaining full application functionality.

## Notes
- The upgrades were major version changes but maintained backward compatibility for our use case
- Vite 7.x introduces performance improvements and better ES module support
- Vitest 3.x provides enhanced testing capabilities and better Vite integration
- Future security updates should be more incremental as we're now on the latest stable versions
