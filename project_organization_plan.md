# GitHub Project Organization Plan
## Customer Management Improvements - Project #6

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - Critical Infrastructure & Core Functionality
**Priority: HIGH** - These are blocking issues that must be resolved first

#### Infrastructure Issues (Critical)
- **Issue #13** üêõ Backend CI/CD: PostgreSQL port conflict preventing service startup
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
  - **Rationale**: Blocks backend testing and CI/CD reliability

#### Frontend Core Functionality Issues (Critical)
- **Issue #15** üêõ Frontend Tests: Mock/Spy system inconsistencies (40% of failures)
  - **Priority**: High  
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
  - **Rationale**: Affects 40% of test failures, blocks reliable frontend testing
  - **Solution**: Implemented consistent global mock system with centralized setup, eliminated conflicting mock approaches, and added test helpers for reliable mock management

- **Issue #16** üêõ Frontend Tests: React hooks setup issue preventing component rendering
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
  - **Rationale**: React hooks not properly configured in test environment, causing "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" error
  - **Root Cause**: React internals dispatcher not properly initialized in vitest + jsdom environment
  - **Next Steps**: 
    1. Update React/React-DOM to latest stable versions
    2. Consider switching from jsdom to Happy DOM
    3. Alternative: Switch from vitest to Jest with React 18 support
    4. Implement custom React test renderer setup
  - **Solution**: Migrated from vitest to Jest with proper React 18 support, resolving React hooks dispatcher initialization issue

- **Issue #20** üîå Frontend Tests: API integration layer not properly mocked
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: Core API functionality not tested, critical integration gap

### Phase 2: User Experience (Weeks 3-4) - Test Quality & UI/UX
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Important for quality and user experience

#### Test Quality & User Experience
- **Issue #17** üß™ Frontend Tests: Snapshot test failures with incorrect expected values
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: Test reliability issue, affects development confidence

- **Issue #21** üîÑ Frontend Tests: Loading states and button management not working properly  
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: UI/UX issue affecting user experience

- **Issue #18** ‚ôø Frontend Tests: Form accessibility role missing
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: Accessibility compliance, important for inclusive design

### Phase 3: Production Features (Weeks 5-6) - Production Readiness
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Production environment optimizations

#### CI/CD & Performance Optimization  
- **Issue #14** üîß Backend CI/CD: Codecov rate limiting prevents coverage upload
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: Affects coverage visibility, production CI/CD completeness

- **Issue #19** ‚ö° Frontend Tests: Performance test threshold too strict for CI environment
  - **Priority**: Medium  
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: CI environment optimization, test pipeline reliability

### Epic Tracking
- **Issue #22** üìã Epic: Resolve all CI/CD test failures identified in comprehensive testing
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Status**: Todo  
  - **Rationale**: Meta-issue tracking overall progress across all phases
