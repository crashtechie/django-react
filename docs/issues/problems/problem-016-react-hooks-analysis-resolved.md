# Issue #16: React Hooks Setup Analysis

## Problem Summary
React hooks fail in test environment with error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')`

## Root Cause
React 18 internals dispatcher not properly initialized in vitest + jsdom test environment.

## Investigation Results

### Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Updated React Testing Library to v14 (React 18 compatible)
2. ✅ Fixed React 18 compatibility flags in test setup
3. ✅ Updated vitest config with proper React plugin
4. ✅ Updated React/React-DOM to latest stable (18.3.1)
5. ✅ Switched from jsdom to Happy DOM
6. ❌ React internals still not properly initialized

### Technical Details
- Error occurs in React's internal `useState` function at line 1622
- React's `ReactCurrentDispatcher` is null during test execution
- Issue affects all components using any React hooks

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Dependency Updates (Recommended)
```bash
# Update core React dependencies
pnpm add react@^18.3.1 react-dom@^18.3.1
pnpm add -D vitest@^2.0.0 jsdom@^25.0.0
```

### Option 2: Environment Switch
```bash
# Replace jsdom with Happy DOM
pnpm remove jsdom
pnpm add -D happy-dom
```
Update `vitest.config.ts`:
```typescript
test: {
  environment: 'happy-dom'
}
```

### Option 3: Jest Migration
```bash
# Switch to Jest
pnpm add -D jest @jest/environment-jsdom
```

### Option 4: Custom Test Renderer
Implement isolated React test environment with proper hooks context.

## Immediate Workaround
- Use integration tests instead of unit tests for hook components
- Mock React hooks at higher level
- Create non-hook test components

## Priority
**High** - Blocks all component testing

## Next Developer Actions
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Updated React dependencies to 18.3.1
2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Switched to Happy DOM
3. **REMAINING OPTIONS**:
   - Try Option 3: Jest migration (most likely to succeed)
   - Try Option 4: Custom React test renderer
   - **RECOMMENDED**: Use workaround with integration tests until resolved

## Current Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Jest migration successfully fixed the React hooks issue!

**Final Solution**: Migrated from vitest to Jest with proper React 18 support. The React hooks dispatcher now initializes correctly, allowing all component tests to pass.

**Test Results**: Component renders successfully with all React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) working properly in the test environment.
