# Issue #25: Install Missing django_filters Dependency

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority**: High  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-01-27

## Problem
Backend tests fail with import error for `django_filters`, blocking backend testing infrastructure.

## Root Cause
The `django_filters` app was missing from `INSTALLED_APPS` in Django settings. While the package was correctly installed, Django couldn't import it because it wasn't registered as an installed application.

## Investigation Results
- ✅ Package `django-filter==25.1` is installed in backend environment
- ✅ Import statement exists in `backend/customers/views.py`
- ❌ `django_filters` was missing from `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py
- ✅ Import works correctly when using `uv run python`

## Solution
Added `django_filters` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `backend/customer_management/settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "rest_framework",
    "corsheaders",
    "django_filters",  # Added this line
    "customers",
]
```

## Verification
- ✅ Import test: `uv run python -c "import django_filters; print('Import successful')"`
- ✅ Backend tests: All 44 tests pass successfully

## Files Affected
- `backend/pyproject.toml` - Dependency declaration
- `backend/customers/views.py` - Import usage
- `backend/customer_management/settings.py` - Potential INSTALLED_APPS configuration

## Prevention
- ✅ Added `django_filters` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- ✅ Verified all backend tests pass
