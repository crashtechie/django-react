# Issue #32: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities

## Security Issue Description
Critical XSS vulnerabilities detected in application code that could allow malicious script injection

## Affected Components
- `frontend/src/pages/CustomerForm.tsx` (Line 85-86)
- `backend/customers/models.py` (Lines 42-43, 47-48)

## Vulnerability Details
User-controllable input is not properly sanitized before being included in output, enabling XSS attacks that could lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Data theft
- Unauthorized actions in user context

## Classification
- [x] Critical (Security vulnerability)
- [ ] High (Major feature broken)
- [ ] Medium (Minor issue)
- [ ] Low (Enhancement)

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Sanitize user input in CustomerForm error messages
- [ ] Implement proper HTML escaping in Django model __str__ methods
- [ ] Add input validation and output encoding
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Add XSS protection middleware
- [ ] Create security tests for XSS prevention

## Technical Requirements
- Use React's built-in XSS protection (avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- Implement Django's html.escape() for model outputs
- Add CSP headers in Nginx configuration
- Use DOMPurify for client-side sanitization if needed

## Estimated Timeline
**2-3 days** (Sprint priority)

## Story Points
8
