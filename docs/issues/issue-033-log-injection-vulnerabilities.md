# Issue #33: Log Injection Vulnerabilities

**Type**: Bug  
**Category**: Security  
**Severity**: Critical

## Security Issue Description
Log injection vulnerabilities detected where unsanitized user input is written to logs, allowing attackers to manipulate log entries

## Affected Components
- `frontend/src/hooks/useErrorHandler.ts` (Line 18-19)
- `frontend/src/pages/CustomerForm.tsx` (Line 67-68)

## Vulnerability Details
User input is logged without sanitization, enabling:
- Log forging and manipulation
- Potential cross-site scripting in log viewers
- Bypassing log monitoring systems

## Classification
- [x] Critical (Security vulnerability)
- [ ] High (Major feature broken)
- [ ] Medium (Minor issue)
- [ ] Low (Enhancement)

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Sanitize error messages before logging in useErrorHandler
- [ ] Remove or sanitize user input from CustomerForm logs
- [ ] Implement log sanitization utility function
- [ ] Add structured logging with safe field separation
- [ ] Review all console.log/console.error statements
- [ ] Add security tests for log injection prevention

## Technical Requirements
- Create sanitizeForLogging() utility function
- Remove newline characters and control sequences from logged data
- Use structured logging format (JSON) where possible
- Implement log level controls for production

## Estimated Timeline
**1-2 days** (Sprint priority)
