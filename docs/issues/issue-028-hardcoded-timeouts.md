# Issue #28: Remove Hardcoded setTimeout Delays in Components

## Bug Description
CustomerList and CustomerDetail components use hardcoded setTimeout delays (1500ms and 1000ms) to simulate API calls, creating unnecessary delays and poor user experience

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to CustomerList page
2. Observe 1.5 second loading delay
3. Navigate to CustomerDetail page  
4. Observe 1 second loading delay

## Expected Behavior
Components should load data immediately or show actual API loading states

## Actual Behavior
Artificial delays simulate API calls without fetching real data

## Environment
- Frontend: React TypeScript
- Files: CustomerList.tsx, CustomerDetail.tsx

## Priority
- [ ] Critical (Production down)
- [ ] High (Major feature broken)
- [x] Medium (Minor issue)
- [ ] Low (Enhancement)

## Technical Requirements
- Replace setTimeout with actual API calls
- Implement proper loading states
- Remove artificial delays
- Connect to backend customer API
