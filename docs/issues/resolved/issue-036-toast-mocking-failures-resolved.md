# Issue #36: Toast Notification Mocking Failures in Tests - RESOLVED

**Type**: Bug  
**Category**: Testing  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Resolution Date**: January 27, 2025

## Bug Description
Frontend tests were failing due to `toast.error` function not being properly mocked, causing TypeError in CustomerForm integration tests

## User Story
As a developer, I want all tests to pass reliably so that I can confidently deploy code changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Fix toast.error TypeError in all test files
- [x] Properly mock react-hot-toast in test environment
- [x] Ensure all CustomerForm integration tests pass
- [x] Add proper toast mocking to test setup
- [x] Verify toast notifications work in actual application

## Technical Requirements
- Mock react-hot-toast in Jest configuration
- Update test setup files to include toast mocks
- Fix all failing integration tests
- Ensure toast functions are properly typed

## Priority
- [x] High (Must have)
- [ ] Medium (Should have)
- [ ] Low (Nice to have)

## ✅ Resolution Summary
Toast mocking failures have been successfully resolved with comprehensive test setup:

### Test Setup Fixes
- ✅ Added proper `react-hot-toast` mock in `tests/unit/frontend/setup.ts`
- ✅ Created persistent `mockToast` object with all required methods
- ✅ Implemented `success`, `error`, `loading`, and `dismiss` mock functions
- ✅ Exported toast mock via `global.__TEST_MOCKS__.toast` for test access
- ✅ Mock functions properly configured with Jest

### Integration Test Fixes
- ✅ CustomerForm integration tests now have access to mocked toast functions
- ✅ TypeError issues resolved for `toast.error` calls
- ✅ All toast-related test failures eliminated
- ✅ Mock functions can be accessed and verified in tests

## Tasks Completed
1. **Setup Toast Mocking** (2 points) - ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - [x] Add react-hot-toast mock to Jest setup
   - [x] Configure global test mocks

2. **Fix Integration Tests** (2 points) - ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - [x] Update CustomerForm integration tests
   - [x] Fix toast-related test failures

3. **Verification** (1 point) - ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - [x] Run all tests to ensure they pass
   - [x] Verify toast notifications work in browser

## Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Mock react-hot-toast
const mockToast = {
  success: jest.fn(),
  error: jest.fn(),
  loading: jest.fn(),
  dismiss: jest.fn()
};

jest.mock('react-hot-toast', () => mockToast);
```

## Verification
- ✅ Toast mocking properly configured in test setup
- ✅ All toast methods available and mockable
- ✅ Integration tests can access and verify toast calls
- ✅ No more TypeError issues in test execution

## Timeline
**Actual Duration**: 1 day (faster than estimated)
**Original Estimate**: 1-2 days

## Story Points
5 (completed)
