# Issue #30: App Missing Error Boundary Wrapper

## Bug Description
Main App component lacks error boundary protection, meaning any unhandled errors will crash the entire application

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Trigger a JavaScript error in any component
2. Observe entire application crashes with white screen
3. No graceful error handling or recovery

## Expected Behavior
Application should catch errors gracefully and show fallback UI while allowing other parts to continue working

## Actual Behavior
Unhandled errors crash the entire application without recovery options

## Environment
- File: App.tsx
- React application root

## Status
**✅ RESOLVED** - 2025-01-27

**Resolved by**: Issue #2 (Error Boundary Components)

## Priority
- [ ] Critical (Production down)
- [x] High (Major feature broken)
- [ ] Medium (Minor issue)
- [ ] Low (Enhancement)

## Technical Requirements
- Wrap App routes with ErrorBoundary component
- Implement fallback UI for error states
- Add error logging and reporting
- Provide recovery mechanisms

## Dependencies
- ✅ Issue #2 (Error Boundary Components) - **COMPLETED**

## Resolution Details
App component now has comprehensive error boundary protection:
- Top-level ErrorBoundary wraps entire application
- Route-level ErrorBoundary wraps routing logic
- Component-level ErrorBoundary wraps individual pages
- Custom error handler logs errors for monitoring
- Graceful fallback UI with retry functionality
