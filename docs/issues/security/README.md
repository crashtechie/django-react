# Security Issues Directory

This directory contains comprehensive security problem documents for identified vulnerabilities in the Customer Management System. Each document follows a security-focused analysis framework with threat assessment, compliance considerations, and detailed remediation strategies.

## Current Security Issues

| Issue ID | Title | CVSS Score | CWE | Priority | Status |
|----------|-------|------------|-----|----------|--------|
| [#34](security-034-command-injection-tools.md) | OS Command Injection in Development Tools | 7.8 (High) | CWE-78 | High | ðŸ”´ Active |
| [#35](security-035-error-handling-security.md) | Error Handling Security Improvements | 6.5 (Medium-High) | CWE-209 | High | ðŸ”´ Active |

## Security Risk Assessment

### Critical Risk Factors
- **Command Injection (Issue #34)**: Direct system compromise possible through development tools
- **Information Disclosure (Issue #35)**: Sensitive data exposure through error messages

### Total Security Impact
- **Combined CVSS Score**: 7.8 (High Risk)
- **Potential Financial Impact**: $6,000-27,000 from security incidents
- **Compliance Risk**: GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2 violations possible
