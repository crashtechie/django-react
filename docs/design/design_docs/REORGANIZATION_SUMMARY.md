### 🧹 Cleanup Completed
- Removed `.mypy_cache/` directory
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent cache directory clutter
- Created comprehensive documentation index

### 📝 Updated References
- Updated `Makefile` script paths
- Updated `README.md` project structure
- Updated all documentation links
- Created `docs/README.md` as documentation index

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**: Reduced clutter with only essential files
2. **Logical Organization**: Related files grouped by purpose
3. **Better Navigation**: Clear directory structure for finding files
4. **Centralized Documentation**: All docs accessible from `docs/` directory
5. **Scalable Structure**: Organized for future project growth
6. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to locate and update files

## 🔗 Key Files Updated

- `README.md` - Updated structure diagram and links
- `Makefile` - Updated script paths
- `.gitignore` - Added cache directory patterns
- `docs/README.md` - New documentation index

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Setup Scripts**: Verify development setup still works with new paths
2. **Update CI/CD**: Check if any GitHub Actions need path updates
3. **Team Communication**: Inform team members of new structure
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all internal links work correctly

## 📋 Verification Checklist

- ✅ All files moved successfully
- ✅ Documentation links updated
- ✅ Script paths updated in Makefile
- ✅ Cache directories cleaned up
- ✅ New directory structure created
- ✅ Documentation index created
- ⏳ Setup scripts testing (recommended)
- ⏳ CI/CD pipeline verification (recommended)

The project is now better organized with a cleaner, more maintainable structure that will scale well as the project grows.
