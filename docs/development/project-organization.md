# GitHub Project Organization Plan
## Customer Management Improvements - Project #6

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - Critical Infrastructure & Core Functionality
**Priority: HIGH** - These are blocking issues that must be resolved first

#### Infrastructure Issues (Critical)
- **Issue #13** üêõ Backend CI/CD: PostgreSQL port conflict preventing service startup
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
  - **Rationale**: Blocks backend testing and CI/CD reliability

#### Frontend Core Functionality Issues (Critical)
- **Issue #15** üêõ Frontend Tests: Mock/Spy system inconsistencies (40% of failures)
  - **Priority**: High  
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
  - **Rationale**: Affects 40% of test failures, blocks reliable frontend testing
  - **Solution**: Implemented consistent global mock system with centralized setup, eliminated conflicting mock approaches, and added test helpers for reliable mock management

- **Issue #16** üêõ Frontend Tests: React hooks setup issue preventing component rendering
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** (Partial - Migration Complete, Cleanup Needed)
  - **Rationale**: React hooks not properly configured in test environment, causing "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" error
  - **Root Cause**: React internals dispatcher not properly initialized in vitest + jsdom environment
  - **Solution**: Migrated from vitest to Jest with proper React 18 support, resolving React hooks dispatcher initialization issue
  - **Remaining Tasks**:
    1. Remove old vitest imports from test files
    2. Update TypeScript configuration for Jest
    3. Clean up mixed testing framework references
    4. Fix TypeScript compilation errors in CI/CD pipeline

- **Issue #20** üîå Frontend Tests: API integration layer not properly mocked
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
  - **Rationale**: Core API functionality not tested, critical integration gap
  - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive API mocking system with global mock setup and test helpers

- **Issue #23** üîß Frontend Tests: Complete vitest to Jest migration cleanup
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
  - **Rationale**: TypeScript compilation errors in CI/CD due to mixed testing framework imports, blocking pipeline completion
  - **Solution**: Successfully migrated all test files from vitest to Jest, removed vitest configuration, updated TypeScript setup, and added Jest DOM type declarations
  - **Completed Tasks**:
    1. ‚úÖ Removed vitest imports from all test files
    2. ‚úÖ Updated test files to use Jest syntax consistently
    3. ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript configuration for Jest environment
    4. ‚úÖ Added Jest DOM type declarations for proper TypeScript support
    5. ‚úÖ Removed vitest.config.ts file
    6. ‚úÖ Updated Jest configuration with proper TypeScript support

### Phase 2: User Experience (Weeks 3-4) - Test Quality & UI/UX
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Important for quality and user experience

#### Test Quality & User Experience
- **Issue #17** üß™ Frontend Tests: Snapshot test failures with incorrect expected values
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: Test reliability issue, affects development confidence

- **Issue #21** üîÑ Frontend Tests: Loading states and button management not working properly  
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: UI/UX issue affecting user experience

- **Issue #18** ‚ôø Frontend Tests: Form accessibility role missing
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: Accessibility compliance, important for inclusive design

### Phase 3: Production Features (Weeks 5-6) - Production Readiness
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Production environment optimizations

#### CI/CD & Performance Optimization  
- **Issue #14** üîß Backend CI/CD: Codecov rate limiting prevents coverage upload
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: Affects coverage visibility, production CI/CD completeness

- **Issue #19** ‚ö° Frontend Tests: Performance test threshold too strict for CI environment
  - **Priority**: Medium  
  - **Status**: Todo
  - **Rationale**: CI environment optimization, test pipeline reliability

### Epic Tracking
- **Issue #22** üìã Epic: Resolve all CI/CD test failures identified in comprehensive testing
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Status**: In Progress (Backend Complete, Frontend Partial)
  - **Rationale**: Meta-issue tracking overall progress across all phases
  - **Progress**: 
    - ‚úÖ Backend CI/CD: All tests passing (44/44)
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend CI/CD: Linting fixed, type checking needs cleanup
