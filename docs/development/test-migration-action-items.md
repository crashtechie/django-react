# Test Migration Action Items

## Overview
Action items identified during the test reorganization to centralized `/tests` directory structure.

## High Priority Issues (Created in GitHub)

### 1. Fix Jest Configuration Property Name
- **GitHub Issue**: Created via automation
- **Problem**: Jest config uses incorrect `moduleNameMapping` property
- **Impact**: Frontend tests cannot execute
- **Files**: `tests/config/jest.config.cjs`, `frontend/jest.config.cjs`
- **Effort**: 15 minutes

### 2. Install Missing django_filters Dependency  
- **GitHub Issue**: Created via automation
- **Problem**: Backend missing `django-filter` package
- **Impact**: Backend tests fail with import error
- **Files**: `backend/pyproject.toml`, Docker configs
- **Effort**: 30 minutes

### 3. Verify Test Path Resolution After Migration
- **GitHub Issue**: Created via automation
- **Problem**: Need to verify all imports work after file moves
- **Impact**: Potential broken test imports
- **Files**: All test files in `/tests` directory
- **Effort**: 1 hour

### 4. Update CI/CD Pipelines for New Test Structure
- **GitHub Issue**: Created via automation
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions may reference old test paths
- **Impact**: CI/CD pipeline failures
- **Files**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- **Effort**: 45 minutes

## Completed Successfully

### ✅ Test File Migration
- Moved 22 test files to centralized structure
- Created organized directory structure
- Updated test configurations

### ✅ E2E Test Verification
- Playwright tests fully functional
- 406 tests found across 6 files
- All browser configurations working

### ✅ Documentation
- Created comprehensive README for tests directory
- Migration summary documentation
- Verification results documented

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate (Today)**
   - Fix Jest configuration property name
   - Install django_filters dependency

2. **This Week**
   - Run full test suite verification
   - Update CI/CD pipeline configurations

3. **Follow-up**
   - Monitor test execution in CI/CD
   - Update team documentation
   - Consider additional test improvements

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All frontend tests execute without errors
- [ ] All backend tests execute without errors  
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully
- [ ] No broken import paths in test files
- [ ] Test coverage reports generate correctly

## Notes

The test migration was structurally successful - all files moved correctly and the E2E tests prove the new structure works. The remaining issues are minor configuration problems that can be quickly resolved.
