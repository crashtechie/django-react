## How to Use These Prompts

### Audience-Specific Approach

- **Executive Prompts**: Focus on business impact, ROI, risk levels, and strategic decisions
- **General Prompts**: Provide balanced technical and business context with practical implications
- **Technical Prompts**: Request detailed technical analysis with code examples and implementation specifications

### Best Practices

1. **Context Preparation**: Ensure you have specific code files, business context, and stakeholder information
2. **Output Specification**: Always specify exact output file paths and formats
3. **Metrics and Validation**: Request specific metrics, timelines, and quantifiable results
4. **Follow-up**: Review generated reports for completeness and validate with subject matter experts

### Integration with Development Workflow

- Incorporate analysis results into sprint planning and roadmap discussions
- Use analysis outputs for technical debt prioritization
- Include security and performance requirements in user stories
- Track implementation of recommendations and measure improvements
